# What's this?
A packet tree printer shamelessly ripped from: https://github.com/salt-die/Advent-of-Code/tree/master/2021/visuals/day_16/packet_printer

I made some modifications because it didn't properly handle leading zeros which broke it for my input.

# How do I run it?
From the parent directory run:
```python3.10 -m packet_printer```

You will, of course, need Python 3.10+ to run it. I leave the installation of Python 3.10 as an exercise for the reader.
